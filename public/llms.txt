## Site Overview

This website provides real-time information about the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic timepiece maintained by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists since 1947. The clock represents how close humanity is to catastrophic destruction (symbolized by midnight).

## Current Status

- **Current Time**: 90 seconds to midnight (as of January 2024)
- **Status**: The closest the clock has ever been to midnight
- **Last Updated**: January 2024
- **Next Expected Update**: January 2026

## Key Facts

### What is the Doomsday Clock?
The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic timepiece created in 1947 by scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project. It represents humanity's proximity to global catastrophe. Midnight symbolizes the end - nuclear war, climate collapse, or other existential disasters.

### Who Controls It?
The Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which includes 13 Nobel Laureates, sets the clock. They evaluate:
- Nuclear weapons and war risks
- Climate change
- Disruptive technologies (AI, bioweapons, cyber threats)
- Global governance effectiveness

### Historical Extremes
- **Closest to midnight**: 90 seconds (2023-present) - Due to Russia-Ukraine war, nuclear tensions, climate crisis
- **Furthest from midnight**: 17 minutes (1991) - End of Cold War, START treaty signed
